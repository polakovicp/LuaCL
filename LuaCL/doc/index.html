	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p>LuaCL is a Lua extension library that binds OpenCL functionality to Lua code. The main goal of LuaCL is achieved by wrapping functions exported by OpenCL library into own functions passed as a table to Lua environment.</p>
	<p>Currently supported version of OpenCL are both 1.0 and 1.1 .</p>

	<h1>Thanks</h1>
	<p>I would like thanks to Ing. Peter Drahos for his advice and leadership during creating this library. Special thanks goes to all, who is willing to share its acquired knowledges.</p>
